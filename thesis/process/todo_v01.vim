done:
implementing the graph visualization in unity

todo:
collapse nodes on same position??? -> what with the different edges/bearings? what are the bearings anyway?
object for each node to be able to rotate/move nodes per hand in unity to be updated on the fly (-> minimization)
create the objective function and calculate for small examples in unity
how to minimize the objective function?
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) literature (e.g. mallot paper)
