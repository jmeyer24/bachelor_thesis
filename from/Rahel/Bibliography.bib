abstract = { Luneburg's model for computation of the curvature K of visual two-dimensional space (horizontal visual surface) was tested with equidistant and parallel alleys in large open spaces. Forty-six subjects used stakes to produce 406 experimental alleys of variable sizes (from 5 × 1 to 240 m × 48 m). The results show that, contrary to results obtained under laboratory conditions with small alleys and light spots, the individual curvature of visual space does not have a negative constant value. K varies in the interval −1 to +1 in ninety computed settings: K ≥ 0 (N = 38); K < 0 (N = 52). Therefore the Lobachevskian geometry currently attributed to visual space ought to be replaced by a Riemannian geometry of variable curvature. Moreover K is an individual function dependant on the size of the alley (distance from the subject), and visual perception would be better understood as scale-dependent. Independently of Luneburg's model we have tested the constancy of the curvature hypothesis in experiments with horopters and visual triangles. The results obtained invalidate Luneburg's hypothesis also. }

abstract = {Experiments connected with Luneburg theory as developed by the author are analyzed with the purpose of making explicit their underlying assumptions. In particular, the role of ad hoc assumptions is explored in detail and minimized wherever possible. It is shown that the special assumptions under which much of the experimental work was executed may be considerably broadened thereby indicating how the theory may be more directly founded upon experiment. The principal problem is the determination of the sensory visual transformation between the geometry of the binocular perception and that of the stimulus, and, in particular, the determination of the visual radial distance function. Three principal techniques, the double circumhoropters, the Blumenfeld alleys, and the equipartitioned geodesics are discussed from this generalized point of view. The specific experimental material treated here consists of results obtained by Zajaczkowska, Shipley, and the Knapp Laboratory group at Columbia University. Some of these results appear for the first time. Theoretical material presented for the first time consists most notably of the analysis of the equipartitioned geodesics, the two-point experiments for the determination of Gaussian curvature, and the meta-theoretical discussions of the several experiments.}

Abstract = {The MAA is delighted to be the publisher of the sixth edition of this book, updated with a new section 15.9 on the author's useful concept of inversive distance. Throughout most of this book, non-Euclidean geometries in spaces of two or three dimensions are treated as specializations of real projective geometry in terms of a simple set of axioms concerning points, lines, planes, incidence, order and continuity, with no mention of the measurement of distances or angles. This synthetic development is followed by the introduction of homogeneous coordinates, beginning with Von Staudt's idea of regarding points as entities that can be added or multiplied. Transformations that preserve incidence are called colineations. They lead in a natural way to elliptic isometries or'congruent transformations'. Following a recommendation by Bertrand Russell, continuity is described in terms of order. Elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are derived from real projective geometry by specializing an ellipti},

abstract = "In a previous study we found large systematic errors (up to 40°) when subjects adjusted the orientation of a horizontal test bar until it appeared parallel to a horizontal reference bar, both bars rotating about their vertical axes. The deviations increased linearly with the separation angle but vanished when the orientation of the reference bar was either parallel or perpendicular to the median line. In order to test the assumption that external references caused these deviations to vanish, the same task was repeated in four different conditions: in the normal condition the horizontal aperture, formed by a cabin, and the facing wall of the room were frontoparallel to the subject; in the other conditions either the room, the cabin or both were oriented 30° to the right with respect to the subject. It was found that, depending on the subject, the occurrence of the vanishing deviations covaried with the orientation of the cabin or the room. Evidently, subjects are influenced by the external references provided by the walls of the room and the sides of the cabin. The results indicate that a description of visual space by a Riemannian metric of constant curvature is not valid in a visual environment containing external references."

abstract = "Binocular vision gives rise to a perceptual space that is endowed with a rich geometrical structure, which according to Luneburg is a non-Euclidean Riemannian geometry of constant Gaussian curvature. This hypothesis, together with certain psychophysical assumptions, provides a qualitative explanation of classical empirical phenomena. The Luneburg theory has been less successful in quantitatively predicting experimental data, a fact that has sometimes been taken as evidence against the presumed geometrical structure. Some of these shortcomings, however, may also be attributed to psychophysical assumptions that are independent of the geometry of visual space, and that were found to be violated systematically. We propose a generalization of Luneburg's psychophysical mapping that can account for these findings. The foundation of a psychologically significant recoordinatization of physical space is formulated within a conjoint measurement approach. It is shown that psychophysical invariances lead to restrictions on the possible form of the coordinate transformation, but its complete specification is left as an open problem. The proposed approach can at least partially explain some empirical observations that are considered to contradict Luneburg's conception of a psychophysical theory of binocular space perception."

 abstract = {We consider the horizontal plane at eye height, that is all objects seen at the horizon. Although this plane visually degenerates into a line in the visual field, the 'depth' dimension nevertheless gives it a two-dimensional structure. We address the problem of intrinsic curvature of this plane. The classical geometric method is based on Gauss's original definition: The angular excess in a triangle equals the integral curvature over the area of the triangle. Angles were directly measured by a novel method of exocentric pointing. Experiments were performed outside, in the natural environment, under natural viewing conditions. The observers were instructed not to move from a set location and to maintain eye height, but were otherwise free to perform eye, head, and body movements. We measured the angular excess for equilateral triangles with sides of 2-20 m, the vantage position at the barycenter. We found angular excesses and deficits of up to 30 degrees. From these data we constructed the metric. The curvature changes from elliptic in near space to hyperbolic in far space. At very large distances the plane becomes parabolic.},

 abstract = {What are the geometric primitives of binocular disparity? The Venetian blind effect and other converging lines of evidence indicate that stereoscopic depth perception derives from disparities of higher-order structure in images of surfaces. Image structure entails spatial variations of intensity, texture, and motion, jointly structured by observed surfaces. The spatial structure of binocular disparity corresponds to the spatial structure of surfaces. Independent spatial coordinates are not necessary for stereoscopic vision. Stereopsis is highly sensitive to structural disparities associated with local surface shape. Disparate positions on retinal anatomy are neither necessary nor sufficient for stereopsis.},

Phenomenologically, such pointings show systematic deviations from veridicality of several degrees. The errors are very small in the vertical and horizontal directions, but appreciable in oblique directions. The magnitude of the error is largely independent of the distance between pointer and target for stretches in the range 2-27°. A general conclusion is that the visual field cannot be described in terms of one of the classical homogeneous spaces, or, alternatively, that the results from pointing involve mechanisms that come after geometry proper has been established.},
